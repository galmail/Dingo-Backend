        <p>PRIVACY POLICY – Dingo App</P>

<P>1.  This Privacy Policy sets out how we will treat the personal information which you provide to us while using the App, “Dingo” (“App”) and/or the services provided from it (“Services”). You are deemed to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy on your first use of the App. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and such changes shall be effective from the date and time the revised Privacy Policy is posted on the App. The App, together with all its content is owned and/or controlled by Allington Ventures Limited (AVL), with a registered office at Chase House, Chase Park Road, Northampton, UK, NN7 1HF. 

2.  To provide the App and the Services, it is necessary for us to hold and process certain personal information. All personal information is processed by us in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. 

3.  From time to time, we may collect or ask you to provide some or all of the following: name, address, date of birth, gender, email addresses and/or mobile phone numbers, IP addresses, web-browser details, operating system details, and/or your activities on the App.  This information will be stored together with any additional information you may provide to us from time to time, and will be used to provide you with the Services and any other services associated with them. We may also use your personal information to analyse use of the App and/or to keep you up-to-date with other products and services, provided by Allington Ventures Limited or our trusted partners, which we think may be of interest to you. 

4.  We will only keep your personal information for as long as is necessary. We may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may involve the sale of certain divisions or the transfer of control of certain divisions to other parties. Data provided by Users will, where relevant, be transferred and the new owner or new controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use such data for the purposes for which it was supplied by you.

5.  We may use 'cookies' while you access the App to avoid the need to re-enter details on different occasions.  This information is used to produce statistical reports on App activity and allows us to tailor the App to suit your interests. Examples include:

• enabling our service to recognise your device so that you don't have to give the same information several times during one task;
• recognising that you may already have given a username and password so that you don't need to do it for every web page requested; and/or,
• measuring how many people are using services, to make the services easier to use and to ensure sufficient capacity for quick delivery to your web browser.

A “cookie” is a small amount of data sent from the server and stored on your devices' hard drive. Most web browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse cookies or ask your browser to show you where a cookie has been set up. Please note that certain features of this App are only activated by the presence of a cookie and if you choose to refuse cookies these features may not be available to you. All modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser or within the ‘settings’ application on your operating system. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful (otherwise you should use the 'Help' option in your browser for more details):

• Cookie settings in Internet Explorer
• Cookie settings in Firefox
• Cookie settings in Chrome
• Cookie settings in Safari

Please note that we do not recommend turning cookies off when using the App as this will prevent you from using many of the services it offers. For further information about cookies and how to control their use, please visit the following third party educational resources: www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu.

6.  The UK Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

7.  We may share the information you have provided with partners of AVL and its affiliates. We may also share this information with other carefully selected companies or organisations in order that they may inform you of their products and services.

You also acknowledge and agree that in certain circumstances we may be obliged to disclose personal information relating to you to third parties, for example, in order to conform to any requirements of law, comply with any legal process, to prevent and detect fraud and to protect and defend our rights and property or amending your settings.

9.  It may be necessary for us to transfer your information to countries outside the European Economic Area which do not provide the same level of protection as the UK. If we for any reason need to do so, we will make sure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable data protection laws so that your personal data is kept secure.
